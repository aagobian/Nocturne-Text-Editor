# Nocturne Text Editor

Nocturne is a sleek, cross-platform text editor built from scratch using Electron and Bootstrap. Featuring a clean, responsive interface, it will offer syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and live code collaboration. The integration of Bootstrap will ensure a modern, intuitive design, while Electron provides seamless operation across Windows, macOS, and Linux.






## Roadmap

- Complete all UI elements

- Add more functionalities (syntax highlighting, auto-completion, file management, etc.)

- Add live code editing (final)
